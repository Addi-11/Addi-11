### Hey there, fellow Earthlings and tech enthusiasts! 🌍💻 
**I'm a Computer Science Engineer with a passion for all things creative and a motivation level that rivals a hyperactive squirrel on caffeine.** From coding to creating, I'm on a quest to build the coolest tech while figuring out how to adult properly. 🚀👩‍💻

My interests are as diverse as a bag of jellybeans—ranging from cognitive sciences to behavioral economics. It's like aiming to be the Elon Musk of tech, but with a more attainable level of coolness. 😎💡

Why do I love tech so much? It's the endless possibilities! **I see technology as the ultimate playground where cognitive sciences and economics come together for an epic party**. 🎉🤖 And the DJ? AI! 🤖🎶

**I believe AI is the superhero cape humanity needs.** It's like a sidekick that helps us understand and change the world in mind-boggling ways. The challenges AI brings are more exciting than a rollercoaster ride. Call me crazy, but I love tackling problems trickier than a Rubik's Cube on steroids. 🤯🤔 
FYI **my "time" on a 3x3 cube is a blazing 68 seconds**! I've conquered the 4x4, 5x5, and even the elusive 6x6, but the mirror cube is still holding out on me. It's like solving a puzzle in a house of mirrors! 🤷‍♂️🌀
So, if you're into tech, humor, and occasional existential crises about the future of AI, buckle up—you've just found your new best tech buddy! 🚀✨👾
