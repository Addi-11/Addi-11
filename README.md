### Hey there,fellow Earthlings and tech enthusiasts! 🌍💻 
**I'm a Computer Science Engineer with a passion for all things creative and a self-motivation level that rivals a hyperactive squirrel on caffeine.** From coding to creating, I'm on a quest to build the coolest tech while simultaneously trying to figure out how to adult properly. 🚀👩‍💻

My interests are as diverse as a bag of jellybeans—ranging from delving into the mysteries of cognitive sciences to attempting to understand the wild world of macro and behavioral economics. It's like I'm trying to be the Elon Musk of the tech world, but with a slightly more attainable level of coolness. 😎💡

Why do I love tech so much, you ask? Well, it's the endless possibilities, my friend! **I see technology as the ultimate playground where cognitive sciences, economics, and whatever else I can throw into the mix come together for an epic party**. 🎉🤖 And who's the DJ at this shindig? None other than Artificial Intelligence! 🤖🎶

**I genuinely believe that AI is not just a tool; it's the superhero cape humanity needs.** It's like having a sidekick that not only helps us understand the world but also has the potential to change it in mind-boggling ways. And you know what's more exciting than a rollercoaster ride? The new and unsolved challenges that AI brings to the table! Call me crazy, but I find joy in tackling problems that are trickier than a Rubik's Cube on steroids. 🤯🤔 
FYI **my "tym" on a 3x3 cube is a blazing 68 seconds—yeah**, I'm talking about that colorful Rubik's Cube wizardry! Learning the art of swift cube-solving is proving to be a real head-scratcher, but hey, progress is progress. 🕒🧩 I've conquered the 4x4, 5x5, and even the elusive 6x6, but the mirror cube is still holding out on me. It's like trying to solve a puzzle in a house of mirrors! 🤷‍♂️🌀

Currently, my brain is doing a cha-cha with socially intelligent machines—machines trying to decode and mimic human behavior. It's like teaching robots to be the life of the party, and I'm here for it. So, if you're into tech, humor, and the occasional existential crisis about the future of AI, buckle up because you've just stumbled upon your new best tech buddy! 🚀✨👾
